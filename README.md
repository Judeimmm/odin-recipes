# odin-recipe
This project is a culmination of what I have learned in this lesson using basic html. My creativity and knowledge of HTML will be displayed in this
project involving a recipe.

reflection:
It was really fun to search the internet for some ideas for recipes that seemed repulsive and gross. Writing the code was really fun too. Overall a great project 8/10.
